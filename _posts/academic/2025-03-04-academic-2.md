&emsp;&emsp;At the 30th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASPDAC â€™25), we presented a cache-free, NUMA-based heterogeneous architecture tailored to the cyclical and modular nature of wireless baseband processing (WBP). Leveraging a novel "pack-and-ship" data dispatching strategy and a multi-level dataflow scheduling model, our system improves data locality and reduces memory latency. Experimental results show up to 2.3Ã— speedup in single-tile performance and a link-level throughput of 288 Mbps, demonstrating strong scalability and superior performance compared to graphics processing units (GPUs) and digital signal processors (DSPs) baselines.
