Welcome to **Echo**, an open-source development platform that unifies **wireless communications** and **artificial intelligence** into a single, powerful programming and simulation environment.

Echo is designed to empower researchers, developers, and engineers to build, accelerate, and deploy next-generation communication systems enhanced by AI. Whether you're prototyping a neural receiver, training an AI-based channel estimator, or designing an end-to-end physical layer system â€” Echo gives you the tools and performance to do it faster and more efficiently.

At the heart of Echo is a **custom domain-specific language (DSL)** inspired by CUDA and ISPC, tailored for high-performance parallel computation on CPU and GPU architectures. This language is tightly integrated with a rich **library of modular wireless communication operators**, enabling expressive and efficient system development. You can use our pre-built applications, or create your own â€” all within a flexible programming model optimized for AI-augmented signal processing.

Echo is more than just a simulation tool â€” itâ€™s a platform for **designing, testing, and experimenting** with novel communication algorithms, AI architectures, and hybrid wireless-AI systems at scale.
