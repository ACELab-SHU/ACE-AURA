## 

Welcome to the **Echo** project! This guide will walk you through setting up your development environment, installing required toolchains, cloning the project, and building the codebase.

### ‚úÖ System Requirements

‚ö†Ô∏è **Linux only** ‚Äî Ubuntu 18.04+(18.04, 20.04, 22.04, 24.04 is tested) or Debian 10+ recommended

* CPU: 4+ cores

* RAM: 16 GB+

* Disk: 150 GB+

* Git ‚â• 2.25

* Python ‚â• 3.8

* CMake ‚â• 3.16
  
  

### üõ† 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl python3 python3-pip libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev libexpat-dev ninja-build git cmake libglib2.0-dev
```

* * *

### üîß 3. Install RISC-V Toolchain & our modified LLVM (for Venus backend)

```bash
# Install RISC-V Toolchain
git clone https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain.git
cd ./riscv-gnu-toolchain

# Generate a compilation file
# The directory /usr/venus_compiler/opt-riscv32-glibc-ima can be modified to any path of your choice.
./configure --prefix=/usr/venus_compiler/opt-riscv32-glibc-ima --with-arch=rv32ima --with-abi=ilp32

# Compile
sudo make
```

```bash
# Install our modified LLVM
git clone https://github.com/ACELab-SHU/Venus-Compiler.git
cd ./Venus-Compiler/venus-llvm-project-venus
mkdir build
cd ./build
sudo apt-get install ccache
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../llvm-bin -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="RISCV" -DLLVM_CCACHE_BUILD=ON -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;llvm" -DLLVM_USE_LINKER=gold -DLLVM_DEFAULT_TARGET_TRIPLE="riscv32-unknown-elf" ../llvm && ninja install
```



After compilation, you will obtain the `opt-riscv32-glibc-ima` directory generated by the RISC-V Toolchain, and the `venus-llvm-project-venus/llvm-bin/bin` directory generated by LLVM.

Make sure to remember these two paths, as you will need to update them later in the **Echo** project.



* * *

### üì¶ 4. Clone the Echo Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ACELab-SHU/OpenAURA.git
cd ./OpenAURA/dsl
vim ./config.mk
```

Modify the `LLVM` path and the `RISC-V GNU toolchain` path in the `config.mk` file.

{% include image.html file="Get_started.png" caption="¬†part of config.mk" %}

You can also modify `TARGET_DAG` to change the build target, but it's recommended not to change it for now ‚Äî just run the test first.



* * *

### üß™ 5. Run a Demo or Test

Open the Echo folder in VSCode, making sure that the top-level folder is **Echo**, then press F5 to start debugging mode directly.

If everything works correctly, you will see the following information printed in the terminal.

{% include image.html file="terminal_out.png" caption="the result of the default dag." %}
