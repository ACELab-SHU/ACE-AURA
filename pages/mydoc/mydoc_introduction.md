🚀 Echo — The Open Platform for Communication–AI Convergence Fusion
===================================================================

🌍 What is Echo?
----------------

**Echo** is an open-source development platform built on **Venus**, our RISC-V processor designed for communication-AI fusion. Echo empowers developers to build, test, and deploy next-generation applications where signal processing meets intelligent computation.

🔧 **Echo includes:**

* 📦 Pre-optimized operators for FFT, MIMO, neural networks, and more
* 🛠️ A full toolchain: compiler, debugger, and hardware simulator
* 🌍 Real-world application demos (5G/LTE, GNSS, LORA, etc.)
* 📖 Comprehensive documentation & tutorials

🧠 Powered by AURA Architecture and Venus Chip
----------------------------------------------

### AURA: AI Unified Radio Architecture

AURA is the foundational computing architecture behind Echo. It is designed for **tight integration of perception, communication, and computation**, optimized for edge and low-latency scenarios.

### Venus: Our RISC-V Communication-AI Chip

Venus is a custom RISC-V processor based on the AURA architecture:

* ⚙️ Instruction set extensions for communication and neural workloads
* 🚀 Built-in accelerators (vector engine, etc.)
* 🌐 Ideal for 5G/6G, GNSS, LoRa, edge AI, V2X, and more
