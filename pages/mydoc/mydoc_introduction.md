 Echo ‚Äî The Open Platform for Communication‚ÄìAI Convergence Fusion
===================================================================

* * *

üåç What Is Echo?
----------------

**Echo** is an open-source development platform built on **Venus**, our RISC-V processor designed for communication-AI fusion. Echo empowers developers to build, test, and deploy next-generation applications where signal processing meets intelligent computation.

 **Echo includes:**

* Communication & AI operators for FFT, Decoder, Conv2D/3D, GELU/SiLU and more
* A full toolchain: compiler, debugger and hardware simulator
* Functional & Performance Simulator: Simulates Venus workloads and output Latency & throughput estimation
* Real-world application demos (5G/LTE, AI-Based Channel Estimation, GNSS, LORA, etc.)
* Comprehensive documentation & tutorials

üîã Powered by AURA Architecture & Venus Chip
----------------------------------------------
**<span style="font-size: 120%; color: red;">AURA: AI Unified Radio Architecture</span>**

AURA is the foundational computing architecture behind Echo. It is designed for **tight integration of perception, communication, and computation**, optimized for edge and low-latency scenarios.It is composed of Venus Language, Zoozve Compiler, and Mathematic Libraries. ( If you want to learn more about compilers, you can see [Zoozve: A Strip-Mining-Free RISC-V Vector Extension with Arbitrary Register Grouping Compilation Support (WIP)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3735452.3735526.html) )

**<span style="font-size: 120%; color: red;">Venus: Our RISC-V Communication-AI Chip</span>**

Venus is a custom RISC-V processor based on the AURA architecture:

* Instruction set extensions for communication and neural workloads
* Built-in accelerators (vector engine, etc.)
* Composed of Venus Tile, Venus Scheduler, and Venus DFE ( For details, see [A Hierarchical Dataflow-Driven Heterogeneous Architecture for Wireless Baseband Processing](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3658617.3697558.html) )
